          My name is Will and I am a full stack
          software developer from the UK.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love to write code and I especially love to solve problems with
          code. I spend most of my time in front of a computer and Iâ€™ve always
          had a huge passion for technology. Recently, I graduated from a Full
          Stack Software Development course at Boolean UK. Previous to this, I
          studied music performance and the British and Irish Institute of
          Modern Music in Fulham, West London. On completion, I went on to tour
          and play with an Artist called Pixel Fix.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the knowledge I have gained, I hope to go on and combine my love
          for arts and creativity with the problem solving aspects of writing
          code.
